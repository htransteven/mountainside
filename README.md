# Mountain Side
Mountain Side began as a project for SB Hacks VI. Due to social-distancing, it has become increasingly difficult to safely connect, study, and interact with your fellow students. Mountain Side is our solution to bring back collaboration and social interaction through online study rooms.

## What can Mountain Side do?

Mountain Side allows UCSB students to create online study rooms similar to those that would have found in the Davidson Library. Students can visit the site to view and join other public study rooms, or bring a group of friends and create their own private room.
